# [Zowe](https://zowe.org/) Sample API Service

Use this sample Spring Boot REST API as a starting point to create a new z/OS-based microservice that:

- Supports basic auth via SAF validation (when running on z/OS)
- Can invoke traditional z/OS services via assembler or metal C interface through JNI
- Is automatically discoverable via the [Zowe API Mediation Layer](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer)

## Prerequisites

Following platform is required to run the application:

- Java JDK 8
  - For example: <https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=openj9>
  - Set `JAVA_HOME` system variable with a valid JDK path and add `${JAVA_HOME}/bin` to the PATH variable

- Zowe CLI (optional)
  - For example: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zowe/cli>

## Quick Start

Download the source code of the sample from <https://github.com/zowe/sample-spring-boot-api-service/releases/latest/download/zowe-rest-api-sample-spring.zip> and unzip it:

```bash
curl -OL https://github.com/zowe/sample-spring-boot-api-service/releases/latest/download/zowe-rest-api-sample-spring.zip
unzip zowe-rest-api-sample-spring.zip
cd zowe-rest-api-sample-spring
```

Build you application:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

**Note:** On Windows use `gradlew` instead of `./gradlew`

Start your application:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

## Use the Application

Open <https://localhost:10080/api/v1/greeting> in your browser or favorite REST API client (for example [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/), [REST Client for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client), or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

Use `zowe` as the username and `zowe` as the password.

The default page <https://localhost:10080/> opens Swagger UI with the API Documentation.
